This project is a Markov team ranking algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). It takes an input from a text file of all games/matches played seperated in the format:

team1 score1 team2 score2

The higher the number next to the team, the higher the rank (teams are not yet sorted by rank).
